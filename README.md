# Incident Management with LLMs

This repo is co-authored by Markus Rollwagen and Luca Perrozzi.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to support incident management processes in IT operations.

## Overview

The notebook explores the application of LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT models, to enhance various aspects of incident management:

- Incident classification
- Root cause analysis
- Solution recommendation
- Knowledge base querying

## Contents

- `Incident-Management-supported-by-LLMs.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations.

## Key Features

- **Incident Classification**: Utilizes LLMs to categorize incidents based on their descriptions[1].
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Employs LLMs to identify potential root causes of incidents[1].
- **Solution Recommendation**: Leverages LLMs to suggest possible solutions for incidents[1].
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Demonstrates how to use LLMs to query a knowledge base for relevant information[1].

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python libraries (listed in the notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Set up your OpenAI API key
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook

## Note

This notebook is for demonstration purposes and may require modifications for production use. Ensure compliance with OpenAI's usage policies and your organization's data handling guidelines.
